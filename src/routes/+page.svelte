<h1>Welcome to a Curated Guide of AP Resources</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Charlotte, and I am a rising junior who scored 5s on the AP World, AP Chem, and AP CSA exams in my sophomore year! As a student who had never taken AP exams before, I know how hard it can be to try to find the best resources--especially if you don't have anyone advising you who took the class previously. For me, this lead to purchasing an insane number of resources, but hopefully this review of those resources can help others who are in the same position!
